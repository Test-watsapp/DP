    Dear {{ love_declaration.to.name }},

    I wanted to express my feelings for you in a format that's as clear and structured as YAML. You are the key to my heart, and your love is the value that makes my life complete.

    ```yaml
    emotions:
      - affection
      - joy
      - happiness
    ```

    Your smile is the anchor in my sea of thoughts, and your laughter is the syntax that brightens my darkest days.

    ```yaml
    happiness_level: 100
    ```

    Let's create a document together called "Love Story," where every moment we share becomes a new entry, and our love continues to grow with each passing day.

    ```yaml
    love_story:
      - date: "{{ current_date }}"
        event: "Our first meeting"
      - date: "{{ future_date }}"
        event: "A lifetime of love together"
    ```

    You are my YAML and I am your data; together, we make a perfect document.

    With all my love,
    Your Admirer
